Background:

CWF Top die showing pull-pad issue due to die burn after electrical die testing. This die burnings are occuring due to ISVM test (measuring current with particular voltage). The test program flow below (typical TPI : SIUP flowplan) showing multiple VCC rails involvement and PDE / test program team wants to which rails are relevant / sensitive towards a die to be burned. In other word, can we find the importance of rails that correlates towards more burn. Identifying sensitive rails would be easier for PDE team to
